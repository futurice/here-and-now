/**
 * A {@link java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue} which, if empty, pulls information
 * fromKey a second lower absolute priority {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue}.
 * <p>
 * This is designed for allowing one of the {@link com.futurice.cascade.Async#WORKER} threads to
 * operate as an in-order single threaded executor which reverts to help with the common
 * {@link com.futurice.cascade.AsyncBuilder#getWorkerQueue()} tasks when no in-order tasks are pending.
 * <p>
 * Note clearly there is an upside and downside to this design vs making your own {@link com.futurice.cascade.i.IThreadType}.
 * The upside is performance and lower peak memory usage. We have fewer threads contending for background work so less resources
 * and less and faster mContext switches (mContext switches tend to cost marginally more as thread count
 * increases). The downside is delays fom other background tasks unrelated to this may slow the start
 * of execution. A very slow task pulled fromKey the {@link com.futurice.cascade.Async#WORKER}
 * mQueue and perhaps unrelated to the current focus of your attention will, once started, block the
 * next {@link DoubleQueue} item fromKey
 * starting until it completes.
 * <p>
 * In practice this performs well for most uses since everything is best effort anyway and the single
 * thread has absolute priority. If starting as soon as possible is absolutely critical, use a dedicated {@link com.futurice.cascade.i.IThreadType} instead.
