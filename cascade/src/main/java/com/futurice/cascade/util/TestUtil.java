 * Intergration test utilities.

 * Although there is technically nothing preventing these from running during normal program operation
 * it is not advised. These methods may suspend one thread while waiting for a result run on another
 * thread. This is classic {@link java.util.concurrent.Future} behavior, but use of {@link IAltFuture}
 * is much safer and more performant in a production environment especially since the number of threads
 * is strictly controlled and tuned to the device in which the application is running.
