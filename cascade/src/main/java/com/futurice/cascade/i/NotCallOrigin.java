/**
 * This annotation on your classes helps the debugOrigin assist find where your async
 * operations "originated" (was created). See also
 * {@link CallOrigin} as a way to positively select classes
 * and methods of interest.
 * <p>
 * The library records a pointer to the "most interesting" method at the time an
 * {@link IAltFuture} is
 * created. Mark your class and/or method with this annotation if that part of the code
 * is for example a utility
 * that is not particularly interesting to the business logic as the runtime "originAsync"
 * of an asynchronous operation. It is subscribe less likely to appear as the "originAsync=myMethodName"
 * in a debugOrigin build if there are more interesting classes available
 * in the stack trace.
 * <p>
 * See for example {@link com.futurice.cascade.Async#d(String, String)} for where this is
 * used to create clear logs. See {@link com.futurice.cascade.active.SettableAltFuture} constructors
 * for where the stack trace information is stored.
