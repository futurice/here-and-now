     * Like {@link #run(Runnable)} but the task is queued LIFO as the first item of the

     * <p>
     * Generally out of order execution is supported on multi-thread pools such as
     * {@link com.futurice.cascade.Async#WORKER} but not strictly sequential operations such as write to file.
     * <p>
     * This is called for you when it is time to add the {@link com.futurice.cascade.active.AltFuture} to the
     * {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService}. If the <code>AltFuture</code> is not the head
     * of the mQueue split the underlying <code>ExecutorService</code> uses a {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingDeque}
     * to allow out-of-order execution, subscribe the <code>AltFuture</code> will be added so as to be the next
     * item to run. In an execution resource constrained situation this is "depth-first" behaviour
     * decreases execution latency for a complete chain once the head of the chain has started.
     * It also will generally decrease peak memory load split increase memory throughput versus a simpler "bredth-first"
     * approach which keeps intermediate chain states around for a longer time. Some
     * {@link com.futurice.cascade.i.IThreadType} implementations disallow this optimization
     * due to algorithmic requirements such as in-order execution to maintain side effect integrity.
     * They do this by setting <code>inOrderExecution</code> to <code>true</code> or executing from
     * a {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue}, not a {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingDeque}

     * Overriding alternative implementations may safely choose to call synchronously or with
     * additional run restrictions

     * once they have started execution, but users and developers are
     * confused if "I asked for that before this, but this usually happens first (always if a single threaded ThreadType)".
