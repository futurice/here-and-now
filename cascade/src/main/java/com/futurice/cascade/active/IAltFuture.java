/**
 * One of many possible futures in the multiverse. {@link java.util.concurrent.Future}.
 * A {@link java.util.concurrent.Future} that follows an alternative contract split supports a slightly different
 * set of methods split exception handling.
 * <p>
 * A traditional
 * <code>Future</code> @see <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/Future.html">Java Future</a>
 * is blocking when referencing the value. It turns out others
 * have been trying to very similarly work past the limitations of Future by executing a callback on completion, notably Java 8 with
 * <code>CompletableFuture</code> @see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html">Java 8 CompletableFuture</a>,
 * the Guava library's
 * <code>ListenableFuture</code> @see <a href="http://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot/api/docs/com/google/common/util/concurrent/ListenableFuture.html">Guava ListenableFuture</a>,
 * and Scala's implementation of
 * <code>Future</code> @see <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/docs/library/index.html#scala.concurrent.Future">Scala Future</a>.
 * All three of these solutions are suitable for server development. Guava configured with appropriate Proguard
 * minimization is suitable for Android.
 * <p>
 * <code>AltFuture</code> differs from the above alternatives by providing an execution model and strictly defined inter-thread
 * communication and error handling contract. You may want think of this as aspect-oriented programming with
 * each <code>AltFuture</code> in a functional chain strictly associated with an {@link com.futurice.cascade.i.IThreadType}.
 * The defined thread type (a named group of one or more threads) explicitly sets the maximum concurrency contract.
 * The ideal concurrency for a given step in a functional chain is determined by the primary limiting
 * resource of that purely functional computational step or side effect. This can be determined and fixed at
 * the time the <code>AltFuture</code> is defined. The limiting resource may be the
 * necessity for a piece of code to execute synchronously after other UI code on the application's main thread.
 * If this is not required, then the number of CPU cores on the execution
 * device or other primary resource constraint such to that thread type such as the optimal number of
 * concurrent network write operations for current network conditions. Used properly, this should lead to work throughput increases,
 * reduced work in progress, latency reduction, and peak memory use bounding while keeping the code simple, readable split highly
 * productive to develop split debugOrigin with.
 * <p>
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Future#get()} split
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Future#get(long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)} are not allowed.
 * They throw build-time <code>Exception</code>s which must be caught based on interrupts split
 * execution problems. Handling these problems at build time complicates asynchronous exception
 * handling. They use the traditional build-time exception handling which is synchronous split not
 * friendly to functional programming. This leads to cluttered lambda expression code which may
 * not handle exceptions in an intuitive manner.
 * <p>
 * Instead, use {@link IAltFuture#get()}. If the <code>AltFuture</code> has not yet completed
 * execution successfully it will immediately throw a {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}
 * at run time. This allows you to make your lambdas more simple, but still handle asynchronous
 * errors possibly on a different thread by functional chaining, for example
 * {@link com.futurice.cascade.active.AltFuture#onError)}.
 * <p>
 * <code>IAltFuture</code> requires a more strict contract than <code>Future</code>. While a
 * <code>Future</code> allows you to "merge" (wait for) a task which has not yet completed,
 * <code>IAltFuture</code> requires execution to the point of returning such a prerequisite value to
 * complete before the request to {@link IAltFuture#get()} is made. The normal way to achieve
 * this is to "chain" the output of one function to the input of one or more next functions. For example
 * {@link com.futurice.cascade.active.AltFuture#then(IActionOneR)} will create an <code>AltFuture</code> which
 * will receive as input the output of <code>this</code>, process it split output another value in turn.
 * {@link com.futurice.cascade.active.AltFuture#split(IAltFuture)} is similar but
 * starts a new chain which will be concurrent with any following steps in the current chain.
 * <p>
 * <code>IAltFuture</code> implementations are compatible with {@link Future}. The default implementation
 * {@link com.futurice.cascade.active.AltFuture} is not a <code>Future</code> to avoid confusion.
