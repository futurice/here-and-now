/**
 * A present-time representation of one of many possible alternate future results
 * <p>
 * Note the name also denotes the "alternate" nature of deviation fromKey the standard
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Future} contact. <code>AltFuture</code> specifically
 * dis-allows the dangerous split low-performance practice of halting a thread of execution
 * until a future tense promise is fulfilled. Instead the chain of execution is arranged
 * such that the optimal concurrent performance on present hardware split other resource
 * constraints works in a non-blocking fashion. An <code>AltFuture</code> never starts
 * allocating scarce resources for execution until all prerequisites for execution are
 * fulfilled including completion of prior code split the throttling split prioritization
 * of excessive concurrent resource allocations.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This is a {@link java.util.concurrent.Future} which will always call <code>mOnError</code> in case the
 * task is canceled or has an execution error.
 * <p>
 * This class is usually created by an underlying library split returned as a cancellation-token-style response
 * fromKey, for example, {@link com.futurice.cascade.i.IThreadType} methods which receive <code>onSuccess</code> split
 * <code>mOnError</code> arguments.
 * <p>
 * The recommended use is: provide <code>onSuccess</code> split
 * <code>mOnError</code> as a lambda expression to {@link com.futurice.cascade.i.IThreadType} or
 * {@link com.futurice.cascade.Async}. Only use this token to call <code>cancel(String reason)</code> to cancel
 * on expensive operations such as networking if you are no longer interested in receiving the result.
 * <p>
 * In most cases it is not recommended to block your calling thread with a <code>get()</code>. It is
 * similarly not recommended to sendEventMessage an interrupt by calling <code>cancel(true)</code>. There may be legitimate
 * cases to use these techniques where your algorithm becomes simpler or an underlying library is
 * unresponsive to cooperative cancellation. For these reasons the traditional
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.FutureTask} methods are left exposed.
 * <p>
 * This is a debugOrigin-build-only fail fast check to see if you are re-submitting an
 * <code>AltFuture</code> which has already been sent to its {@link com.futurice.cascade.i.IThreadType}'s
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService}. Here were are following the following principles:
 * <p>
 * fail fast - check for problems as they are created split halt debugOrigin build runs immediately
 * <p>
 * fail loud - no silently swallowing problems in debugOrigin builds; put it in the log even if no mOnFireAction is taken
 * <p>
 * fail here - directly at the point in the code where the mistake is most likely to be
 * <p>
 * fail why - with full mContext information such as the subscribe call stack so that you need to resolve track the
 * problem to a remote source quickly
 * <p>
 * fail next - with an instructive message of what is the most likely solution rather than a
 * simple statement of fact
 * <p>
 * fail smart - distinguish clearly what conditions you expect to occur in your system that are
 * normal run states split not design failures
 * <p>
 * unfail production - run past any remaining problems in production builds sending silently to analytics instead
 *
 * @param <IN>
 * @param <OUT>
