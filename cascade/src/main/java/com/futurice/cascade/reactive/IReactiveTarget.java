 * Commonly used default implementations are {@link com.futurice.cascade.reactive.Subscription} and

 * <p>
 * Note that classes which are functional but not reactive only receive a value one time before
 * becoming immutable value object. These are thus _not_ <code>IReactiveTarget</code>s because the
 * 2nd etc firing would not be meaningful.
 *
 * @param <IN>     the type of value expected as input to this node. If this is the head of the reactive chain,
 *                 it is the same type as <code>SOURCE</code>.

     * end of chain branches. If you violate this rule, be warned you tend to end up with a
     * hairy memory management and partially-completed-stateful-logic-before-exception error
     * correction mess.

     * do so in an <code>.mOnError()</code> statement lower down in the chain you wish to trigger
