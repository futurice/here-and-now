/**
 * An object you can bind _from_ to receive updates each time this object decides to emit them.
 * <p>
 * A common implementation is {@link com.futurice.cascade.reactive.ReactiveValue} which will concurrently emit
 * to all its down-chain bindings each time it changes.
 * <p>
 * See also {@link IReactiveTarget}
 * <p>
 * Unlike the single-use objects in {@link com.futurice.cascade.i.active}, the chain created is
 * suitable for multiple firings. Chains of {@link IReactiveSource}
 * functions are usually held with a weak reference at their head. They will automatically collapse
 * and clean up the binding at the same time the leaf node is garbage collected. Any firing which started
 * before garbage collection may lead to a value which is discarded. The same is true even if you manually
 * {@link com.futurice.cascade.reactive.ReactiveValue#unsubscribe(String, IReactiveTarget)} so the automatic cleanup is equivalent.
 * Still, some people are paranoid, and others just like changing diapers and doing dirty plumbing work.
 * Feel free to do it manually. If you want to be controversial, do so in the {@link Object#finalize()}
 * method of the leaf node. It could be argued that if <code>.finalize()</code> was not called for
 * a long time, you didn't have a problem or leak in the first place so why worry.
 * <p>
 * If your reactive chain branches, be sure to prune just the branch of interest. A reactive chain is
 * said to "branch" when there are multiple <code>.subscribe()</code> statements
 * from a single <code>IReactiveSource</code>). The end node of a reactive chain is called the
 * "leaf node". The leaf node is "live" if it is strongly referenced and not free for garbage
 * collection. If the reactive chain branches, only that section
 * of the reactive function free which is no longer needed by a live leaf node will
 * collapse and be garbage collected to prevent useless firing. Check the logs for notification when this occurs.
 * <p>
 * If your reactive chain is strongly referenced in some other way, automatic cleanup will be defeated.
 * A typical way to do this is use an anonymous inner class instead of a lambda expression. Anonymous
 * inner classes from within the leaf node or its non-persistent child objects are not a problem.
 * <p>
 * A second even more sneaky way to defeat the automatic memory cleanup of unused reactive chains is: include
 * a closure reference in your lambda expressions to some object that will not be garbage collected
 * when the leaf nod of the reactive function chain is garbage collected. So you can freely
 * incorporate closures into your lambda and not manually call {@link com.futurice.cascade.reactive.ReactiveValue#unsubscribe(String, IReactiveTarget)}
 * <em>only</em> if the closures reference objects that will not hang around past the end of the
 * useful life of the reactive chain.
