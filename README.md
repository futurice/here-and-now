# Here and Now
Software and hardware for turning your open office into an open, realtime map for finding people, open work places and current events

Although this is an Android project, it requires Java 8 for compilation with retrolambda. Install JDK8. Android Studio can be run with either JDK7 (supported) or JDK8 (works) but you must specify JDK8 for the project settings.

To use this project, you must also clone https://github.com/futurice/cascade/ into the same parent directoy and switch
to branch "here-and-now". So for example if you clone this repo into /android, you would also clone Reactive Cascade into /android where the Here and Now code expects to find it. If the "here-and-now" branch of Cascade is not available, a ReactiveCascade.zip archive version is available as a backup. With time a more normal dependency arrangement will be used- that will require a few changes to both projects.
